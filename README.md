# calculator-java
Project of a basic calculator with the goal of improving my initial knowledge in the Java programming language.

In this activity, I aim to apply basic programming concepts such as input, mathematical operations, and displaying results on the screen. The goal is to create a simple calculator capable of performing the four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with two numbers provided by the user.
